# Project #: Stardew Valley Project 2

* Author: Lance Chandler
* Class: CS321 Section #2

## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

The program runs a simmulation of the game stardew valley. It has a varety of tasks that it can have the "farmer" do.

## Reflection

Write a two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this 
project.  Talk about what worked well and what was challenging.  
Did you run into an issue that took some time to figure out?  
Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel
free to add other items (within the two paragraph limit).

I ran into a litany of issues while creating this assignment, mainly from not knowing where to find a lot fo the answers to what things do. I tried to read the already created files, but found them overly confusing and not well explained. I had a lot of trouble integrating my files into theirs. I also had a lot of trouble with the insert function, mainly due to the limits on how big an array can get.

The files in which we impliment interfaces were much easier to do that the one where we had to create our own.

## Compiling and Using
The code does not require that you compile yourself, as the .sh file will do that for you.
 
### To run this simmulation:

```bash
bash run-tests.sh
```
