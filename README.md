# Project #: Stardew Valley Project 2

## Overview

The program runs a simmulation of the game stardew valley. It has a varety of tasks that it can have the "farmer" do. Everyday it goes through and has luck of the day paremeter, which it uses to determine if there is a task generated. The farmer then goes through and does his tasks until he runs out of energy. At that point he ends the day.

## Reflection

I ran into a litany of issues while creating this assignment, mainly from not knowing where to find a lot fo the answers to what things do. I tried to read the already created files, but found them overly confusing and not well explained. I had a lot of trouble integrating my files into theirs. I also had a lot of trouble with the insert function, mainly due to the limits on how big an array can get.

The files in which we impliment interfaces were much easier to do that the one where we had to create our own.

In the end I needed a lot of help with this assignment, but I can reasonably say that I learned a ton about the language java as well as implimenting abstact data types as well as the data structure maxheap.

## Compiling and Using
The code does not require that you compile yourself, as the .sh file will do that for you.
 
### To run this simmulation:

```bash
bash run-tests.sh
```
